Draw-It-or-Lose-It Project

Led the development of a web-based adaptation of Draw-It-or-Lose-It, a collaborative guessing game involving multiple teams. This project aimed to ensure seamless performance across various platforms including PC, mobile, and tablets.

Project Overview:

Created a dynamic gaming experience with timed rounds and collaborative drawing and guessing mechanics.
Implemented a responsive design to accommodate different device specifications and optimize application memory usage.
Developed team management functionalities, allowing players to create teams and assign unique names.

Technical Approach:

Utilized Java programming to build an object-oriented application, focusing on scalability and maintainability.
Provided detailed consideration of different operating systems (OS), optimizing performance and user experience.
Incorporated feedback mechanisms and iterative testing to refine user interface and enhance overall usability.

Key Contributions:

Successfully integrated real-time drawing capabilities and synchronized guessing mechanisms across multiple devices.
Addressed memory management challenges to ensure efficient application performance on all supported platforms.
Advocated for visual enhancements in future iterations to enrich user engagement and experience.

This project highlighted my proficiency in Java programming, strategic approach to software design, and commitment to delivering a robust, user-friendly application across diverse operating environments.
