# Draw-It-or-Lose-It
We will be creating a web-based version of Draw It or Lose It. The game consists of at least two teams guessing what is being drawn. There are four rounds lasting for one minute. The image will take thirty seconds to be fully complete. The team thatâ€™s guessing will have to guess what is being drawn within the time limit if not the other team gets fifteen seconds to guess one time. This app will have to be able to perform on all devices such as PC, mobile or table. We will need to take into consideration the application memory and be able to create teams and unique name players. We will be solving this problem with java programming to provide an object-oriented program. In this software design i feel I gave good detail on the deffernt OS. I find list out the different OS and there benefits help with the app design. If i could revise something about my software design i would add visuals. Knowing that the user would need lots of memory help me and my design. I would use the side by side comparesion in furture designs.
